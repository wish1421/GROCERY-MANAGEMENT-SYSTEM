# GROCERY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
This is my class 12th CBSE Project, done in a group of three. Browse this repository for details:
The GROCERY MANAGEMENT program developed by us is an efficient inventory monitor of stock which consists of thousands of items of different types, prices and status of availability.
This program is imperative for organizing and keeping track of items in a way that saves time and is methodical.
